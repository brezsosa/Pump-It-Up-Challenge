This script contains the code that I used to solve the 'Pump It Up' competition  on Driven Data website. 

The datasets for the competition can be found at https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/7/pump-it-up-data-mining-the-water-table/data/

The final scores that I obtained with each model are included as comments at the end of the script.
